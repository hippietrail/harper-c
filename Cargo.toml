# Cargo.toml - Configuration file for the Rust library project

[package] # This section defines the package metadata
name = "harper-c" # The name of the package, used when publishing or building
version = "0.1.0" # The current version of the package, following semantic versioning
edition = "2021" # The Rust edition to use; 2021 is the latest as of now

[lib] # This section specifies settings related to the library
crate-type = ["cdylib"] # This tells Cargo to compile the library as a dynamic library (CDylib)
# A CDylib is suitable for linking with C code, allowing C programs to call Rust functions.

[dependencies] # This section lists the dependencies required by the package
harper-core = { path = "../harper-core" } # This specifies a local dependency on the harper-core library
# The path points to the location of the harper-core library, which is expected to be in the parent directory.
# If harper-core were published on crates.io, you could specify it like this:
# harper-core = "0.1.0"

[workspace] # This section is for workspace configuration
# An empty workspace section indicates that this package is not part of a larger workspace.
# This allows users to build this example independently without needing to modify or include other packages.
